# SyncBot

Version -- SyncBot v1.0 
Use the command !create groupName and let the bot handle the rest. This will:
- Create a new role named after your group. Used to distinguish members and create sub-groups within the server. 
- Set up a dedicated channel for the group. (Currently in a dedicated Category called "ROLE SPECIFIC CHANNELS")
- Generate a standardized post for others to join by reacting with a üëç.
- Keep track of number of members in learning group on post.
