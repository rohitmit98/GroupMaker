# SyncBot

Version -- SyncBot v1.0 
Use the command !create groupName and let the bot handle the rest. This will:
- Create a new role named after your group. Used to distinguish members and create sub-groups within the server. 
- Set up a dedicated channel for the group. (Currently in a dedicated Category called "ROLE SPECIFIC CHANNELS 🔐")
- Generate a standardized post for others to join by reacting with a 👍. (Currently in a dedicate channel called #active-learning-groups)
- Keep track of number of members in learning group on post. 

## Example Usage:

!create stanfordcs229
It would be beneficial to get a general idea of the fundamentals used in ML before getting into creating models or using algorithms even. I'll be starting this course on Monday, August 14th. I'll pace myself at roughly 1 lecture per week. Each week I’d like to review and discuss with others who join.  

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Linear Algebra, Statistics/Probability (can be studied alongside if needed)
**Estimated Timeframe:** 5-8 Months
